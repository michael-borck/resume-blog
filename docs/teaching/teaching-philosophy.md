My teaching philosophy is grounded in three conceptual pillars: **Caring**, **Competence**, and **Passion**. I believe that education should be an inspiring and transformative journey, and I strive to create a dynamic and inclusive classroom environment where students feel encouraged to explore, question, and apply their knowledge.

### Caring

- Treat everyone as a person.
- Treat everyone how you would like to be treated.
- Show compassion (not us vs them).
- Be a nice person.

### Competence

- Ensure preparedness (readings, labs, tutorials, etc.).
- Be knowledgeable about the subject matter.
- Notice and address any gaps in knowledge or skills.

### Passion

- The act of teaching: Utilize models like KSA, Bloom's Taxonomy, and Gagn√©'s Nine Events of Instruction.
- Love of material: Convey excitement and relevance of the material to students.
- Relate content to real-world applications.

## Examples of Teaching Practices

- **Critical First Classes**: Setting the tone and expectations from the beginning.
- **Private Praise**: Providing personalized feedback to encourage students.
- **Flexible Office Hours**: Being available to support students' varying schedules.
- **Skeletal PowerPoints**: Using minimal slides to encourage active participation.
- **First to Arrive, Last to Leave**: Demonstrating commitment and availability.
- **Guidance on Focus**: Teaching students where to look, not just what to see.
- **Out-of-Hours Access Near Deadlines**: Providing extra support when students need it most.

While my professional life revolves around teaching and research, my personal passions are equally eclectic and fulfilling. I find joy in exploring the world through different lenses, whether it's through a telescope capturing the wonders of the night sky or a macro lens revealing the intricate details of my backyard's ecosystem. I'm also an avid 3D printing enthusiast, constantly tinkering with new creations, and a budding musician, finding solace and expression in the strum of a guitar. My love for retro gaming and martial arts also provides a balance of nostalgia and physicality in my life.

You can learn more about my hobbies and passions on my [Passions page](/passions/), where I dive deeper into my love for astrophotography, 3D printing, martial arts, tennis, guitar, and retro gaming.

## Project Overview

CloudCore is a microservices platform I designed and implemented to solve the common challenges of distributed systems deployment and management. The platform provides a unified way to develop, deploy, and monitor microservices while maintaining high availability and fault tolerance.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Go for core services, Node.js for API gateway
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Istio service mesh
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Database**: CockroachDB for distributed SQL

## Key Features

### Service Discovery and Configuration

CloudCore includes a robust service discovery mechanism that automatically registers and discovers services across clusters. The configuration management system allows for dynamic updates without service disruption.

### Resilience Patterns

The platform implements circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, and bulkheads to ensure system stability even during partial outages. Each service operates in isolation, preventing cascading failures.

### Observability

Comprehensive tracing, metrics, and logging give operators full visibility into the system's behavior. Custom dashboards provide real-time insights into service health and performance.

## Impact and Results

CloudCore has been adopted by three internal teams, reducing their deployment time by 65% and improving system reliability. The platform has handled production workloads with 99.99% uptime over the past year.

## Lessons Learned

Building CloudCore taught me valuable lessons about distributed systems design, particularly around consistency models and failure handling. The project reinforced my belief in "design for failure" as a core principle when building resilient systems.

TrueRoll is an simulation toolkit designed for modelling ten-pin bowling games. It offers a comprehensive suite of classes that simulate games, tournaments, leagues, and more, providing a realistic and detailed representation of bowling dynamics. The project also includes a scoring system compatible with various bowling rules, a database for persisting game results, and an environment setup using poetry for easy package management.

You can find the source code and additional details on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michael-borck/trueroll).

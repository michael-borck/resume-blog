SimNexus, one of my key projects that showcases my expertise in developing software for use in education, business and economics. As the creator and maintainer of SimNexus, have designed this tool to help users explore and understand the dynamics of product popularity, stock market behaviour, and resource price fluctuations. SimNexus offers a hands-on experience that brings theoretical concepts to life through practical application.

SimNexus is perfect for students, educators, and analysts looking to analyze how marketing strategies, economic trends, and supply disruptions affect market behaviors. My comprehensive documentation and user-friendly tutorials make it easy to get started. By creating and maintaining SimNexus, I aim to provide valuable insights into the forces driving market dynamics and enhance decision-making in the complex world of economics. Check out the links to GitHub, PyPI, and the detailed API documentation for more information on how to use this powerful framework.

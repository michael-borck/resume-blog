## From Curiosity to Obsession

My journey into 3D printing began as simple curiosity—could I really create physical objects from digital designs? Five years later, what started as a hobby has evolved into a passionate pursuit that has transformed how I approach problems in both my personal and professional life.

## Learning Through Creation

I've learned that 3D printing isn't just about making things; it's about understanding design constraints, material properties, and structural integrity. The iterative nature of printing—design, test, refine, repeat—mirrors the software development process I use professionally.

## Beyond Plastic Trinkets

While I started with simple decorative items, I quickly moved to functional prints: custom organization systems, replacement parts for household items, and educational models. My most ambitious project was a fully articulated robotic arm with custom electronics that could be controlled via a mobile app I developed.

## Sharing the Journey

I've found joy in introducing others to 3D printing, especially children who light up when they see their ideas materialize. I've run workshops at local schools, teaching basic CAD principles and letting students experience the satisfaction of creating something tangible from their imagination.

## What's Next?

I'm currently exploring bioprinting and advanced materials. The field is constantly evolving, and I'm excited to continue growing with it, applying what I learn to solve increasingly complex problems.
